# 🕒 On-Call Calculator

**A professional, privacy-first tool for tracking billable hours, managing multi-day shifts, and generating effortless invoice summaries.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **On-Call Calculator** is a beautiful, web-based utility designed for contractors, freelancers, and on-call professionals. It replaces messy spreadsheets and manual math with a sleek, glassmorphic interface that handles all your time-tracking nuances—from driving time to unpaid breaks.

It doesn't just calculate hours; it formats them into a clean, professional summary ready to paste directly into Xero, QuickBooks, Salesforce, or your email.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📅 **Multi-Day & Shift Management**
-   **Add Infinite Shifts**: Seamlessly handle jobs that span multiple days or separate call-outs.
-   **Individual Tracking**: Each shift has its own start time, end time, and break duration.

### 🚗 **Smart Driving Breakdown**
-   **Split Reporting**: Option to separate "Driving Time" from "On-Site Time" for clients who bill differently for travel.
-   **Precision Inputs**: distinct fields for "Drive There" and "Drive Back" to ensure every minute is captured.

### ⏱️ **Intelligent Calculations**
-   **Auto-Deductions**: Automatically subtracts unpaid break times from your on-site hours.
-   **Validation**: Built-in logic prevents errors like end times being before start times or breaks longer than shifts.

### 📋 **Instant Invoice Generation**
-   **One-Click Output**: Generates a perfectly formatted text block with dates, times, breakdowns, and totals.
-   **Copy-Paste Ready**: A single button copies the entire summary to your clipboard.

### 🔒 **Privacy & Tech**
-   **100% Client-Side**: No database, no accounts, no tracking. Your data never leaves your browser.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile.
-   **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with semantic HTML5, Glassmorphism CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
